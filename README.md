# Crowdfunding-ETL

##Overview

###In this Challenge, you’ll use Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. Specifically, you’ll extract and transform the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file. You'll then do the load phase. Specifically, you’ll use the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. And, you’ll upload the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. Finally, you’ll perform a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.
